# Multiple-Hyperlinks-on-Image
Have different links on single image.

 Create multiple "Hot Spots" linking within a single image, without slicing any image for linking.
 For instance, your client has given you a list of sponsors and he wants each of the logo to be linked to the sponsor's web page on his website. This will make your job much easier.
